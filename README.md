# SofdecVideoTools
**A set of GUI programs for processes related to Sofdec video files, designed for Windows.**

These programs are intended to be more user-friendly alternatives and/or replacements to older SFD programs, such as SEGA Dreamcast Movie Creator.

Instructions for properly setting up everything up can be found in the included documentation found in the program(s), or in the Downloads + Documentation section below.

Support for .usm files and/or some audio types (AIX audio, MP2 audio) used in some SFDs is not currently supported in these programs.

For developers, feel free to use the code in this repo for your own projects, all I ask is that you do NOT use the code for malicious purposes, such as viruses, fake installers, spyware and/or adware, etc.

## O&A
**Q:** How big are the programs when extracted?

**A:** They are about 30MB.



**Q:** A prompt comes up saying "Windows protect your PC". What is this, and what do I do to bypass it?

**A:** This happens with programs not recognized by the Windows software database. To bypass it, click on "More info", then on "Run Anyway". The programs should boot after that.
